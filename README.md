# DataScape: Mastering Database Design

### **About the Project**

This project is part of the comprehensive **ALX Airbnb Database Module** , focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

### **Learning Objectives**

As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:

- Apply advanced principles of **database design** to model complex systems.
- Master the art of **normalization** to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- Use **SQL DDL** to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
- Write and execute **SQL DML** scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

### **Requirements**

To successfully complete these tasks, you must:

1. Have a strong foundation in **relational databases** and SQL.
2. Be proficient in using **Draw.io** or similar tools for visual modeling.
3. Possess a good understanding of **data normalization principles** , particularly up to 3NF.
4. Have experience with GitHub repositories for documentation and project submission.
5. Follow industry best practices for database design and scripting.

### **Key Highlights**

- **Task 1** : Craft a detailed **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.
- **Task 2** : Apply **normalization principles** to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
- **Task 3** : Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.
- **Task 4** : Populate the database with **real-world sample data** , simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.

Each task builds on the previous one, providing a step-by-step approach to developing a robust database system. By completing this project, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with real-world database challenges, preparing you for complex projects in professional environments.
